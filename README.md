# TR1Remastered-QA-Checklist-&-Bug-Examples

This checklist was created for the opening “Caves” level of the Tomb Raider 1 Remastered game, using the modernized graphics mode as the visual reference. 
The goal was to build a universal QA framework that can be reused and expanded to test other levels in the game.



### 🧠 Why Tomb Raider 1?
Due to its recognizable mechanics and clean structure, TR1 serves as a perfect foundation for building clear, consistent, and scalable checklist. 
My additional experience with the Tomb Raider Level Editor provided insight into how certain mechanics function under the hood.
To ensure a thorough and relevant checklist, I also researched various community forums to identify the most common bugs and edge cases encountered by players.

**Note:** This is a fan-made checklist created for portfolio purposes and is not affiliated with the official developers of Tomb Raider 1 Remastered.


### ✅ Checklist Design Principles

* 🎯 One Item = One Check – Each test case targets a single, isolated behaviour for easier tracking and debugging.


* 🔄 Logical Flow – Sections are arranged to match the natural gameplay progression, from level start to completion.


* 📂 Categorized Structure – Checks are grouped into intuitive categories (e.g., Enemies, Traps, Items) for easier navigation and test planning.


* 🚦 Prioritization – Tests are marked by importance (High / Medium) to help testers focus on critical issues first.


* 🗣️ Clear and Actionable Language – All checks are written with direct, unambiguous language to reduce guesswork.


* ➕ Positive and Negative Test Cases – The checklist covers both expected behaviours and scenarios where things might go wrong.


* 🧪 Edge Cases – Special consideration is given to unusual or extreme situations that could break intended functionality.
